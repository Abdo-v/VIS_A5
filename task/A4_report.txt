Abdalrahman Mohammed 2 WS 25
 Supports A2 by allowing ranking of regions with highest sea-level rise (where available).
 Supports A3 by providing additional hazard information for coastal countries.
User Group Data Journalists:
J1- Demonstrate how climate change indicators in Austria compare to other countries
J2- show a climate tax/expenditure discrepancy comparison between Austria and a selected country
J3- show the relation between Fossil Fuel subsidies and environmental taxes for different countries
Data journalists specialize in communicating complex environmental, political, and economic patterns in a way that the general public can
understand. Their work requires identifying clear, evidence-based differences between Austria and other countries, revealing inconsistencies in
policy, and highlighting trends relevant to climate reporting.
They need tools that allow:
 Fast comparison between Austria and other countries
 Detection of discrepancies between taxation and expenditures
 Understanding of relationships between subsidies and climate-policy signals
 Access to both overview and detail views for storytelling
 Simple interactions (no expert skills required)
The DJ dashboard (overview mode + selectable comparison mode, linked scatter, discrepancy trends, bar charts) directly supports these needs.
Tasks for Data Journalists (J1–J3)
(domain tasks only; abstraction will come later)
J1 — Compare Austria to other countries using climate-relevant financial and environmental indicators
In overview mode, the dashboard displays a comparison between Austria and world averages for:
 temperature anomaly
 CO₂ emissions
 disaster frequency
Selecting any country replaces the global average with that country.
This allows journalists to answer: “How does Austria compare overall?”
J2 — Compare the discrepancy between environmental taxes and environmental protection expenditures
Journalists often investigate whether countries reinvest their environmental tax revenue.
The discrepancy view shows:
(taxes – expenditures) over time.
In detail mode, Austria is compared directly to a selected country.
J3 — Analyze the relationship between fossil-fuel subsidies and environmental taxes across countries
The scatter plot uses:
 x-axis: fossil fuel subsidies
 y-axis: environmental taxes
An ideal view for detecting contradictions (e.g., high taxes but also high subsidies).
Austria is highlighted for quick identification.
Dataset Description

3. Functionality and usability of the dashboards
(10 points each per dashboard = 40 points)
Dashboard 1: Activists from WWF
Abdalrahman Mohammed 5 WS 25
The WWF dashboard is designed to support Tasks A1–A3, enabling activists to investigate global climate-change impacts, compare
countries, and retrieve detailed information about specific regions. The dashboard consists of four linked views, each providing a distinct
analytical perspective:
1. World Map Overview,
2. Impact-Over-Time View (Three Line Charts),
3. Ranking View,
4. Disaster-Type Distribution (Sankey Diagram).
The dashboard opens in overview mode, showing global patterns. Selecting any country shifts the dashboard into detail mode, where all
views update to focus on the chosen region. A “Remove Selection” button returns the dashboard to the global overview state.
Overview of Interactions and Linking
The dashboard uses a bidirectional linking strategy, where actions in one view update all others. Key interactions include:
 Selecting a country on the map updates the line charts, the Sankey diagram, and the ranking view.
 Selecting a metric (temperature, sea-level, or disasters) from the line charts updates the ranking bar chart to show “Top 5 +
selected country.”
 Clicking on any point along the disaster-frequency time series updates the Sankey diagram to show the disaster-type
distribution for that year.
 Hovering over elements in any chart displays tooltips (title + precise value).
 Hovering over countries on the map displays the country name.
This ensures that all four views are coordinated, supporting exploratory analysis (A1), comparative ranking (A2), and detail-on-demand
(A3).
View 1 — World Map Overview
Description
The world map displays global disaster frequency using a choropleth or marker-based encoding. In overview mode, it animates or steps
through time to illustrate how disaster frequency has evolved. In detail mode, selecting a country centers the dashboard on that region.
Supported Tasks:
 A1 (discover regional climate impacts)
 A3 (select a country for details)
Interactivity:
 Hover: Shows country name and latest disaster frequency.
 Click/Select: Filters all other views to the selected country.
 “Remove selection” button: Returns to overview mode.
Why a map for A1/A3?
Maps provide the most intuitive geographic overview, enabling users to visually detect hotspots. Spatial tasks (locating affected regions,
comparing continents) rely on geographic encodings, which match the natural mental model of WWF analysts.
Usability Notes:
 Uses color saturation (high contrast, perceptually ordered) to show disaster frequency.
 No excessive labels to avoid clutter.
 One-glance identification of high-risk areas → excellent expressiveness for A1.
View 2 — Impact-Over-Time View (Three Linked Line Charts)
(temperature change, sea-level rise, disaster frequency)
Description
Three small-multiple line charts show the long-term evolution of each climate metric. In overview mode, the charts show global averages; in
detail mode, they show values for the selected country.
Supported Tasks:
 A1 (explore temporal climate impacts)
 A2 (choose metric for ranking)
 A3 (inspect detailed evolution for selected country)
Interactivity:
 Select metric: Clicking a line chart title sets the ranking chart to use that metric.
Abdalrahman Mohammed 6 WS 25
 Click on a line-node (year): Updates the Sankey diagram to show disaster types for that specific year.
 Hover: Displays a tooltip with exact year + value.
Why line charts for A1–A3?
Line charts are optimal for trend-related tasks, enabling comparison of slopes and long-term changes. This supports identifying rapid
warming, increasing disasters, or acceleration in sea-level rise.
Usability Notes:
 Three separate charts avoid overplotting and giving false relation.
 Consistent x-axis (years) across all charts increases interpretability.
 Color-coded lines match the metric selection mechanism.
View 3 — Ranking of Countries by Selected Metric (Bar Chart)
Description
This vertical bar chart shows the Top 5 countries + selected country for the metric chosen via the line charts (temperature change, sea-
level rise, disaster frequency). In overview mode, it displays the ranking for disaster frequency.
Supported Tasks:
 A2 (ranking countries based on user-selected metric)
Interactivity:
 Selecting a metric in the line chart updates the ranking automatically.
 Hover displays the exact metric value.
 Click on a country highlights it on the map and updates the detail views.
Why bar charts for A2?
Bar charts are optimal for ranking tasks because:
 They provide a clear magnitude comparison.
 Ordering encodes ranking naturally.
 Length is one of the most accurate perceptual channel for quantitative values.
View 4 — Disaster-Type Distribution (Sankey Diagram)
Description
The Sankey diagram shows the composition of disasters (floods, storms, droughts, heatwaves, etc.) for the selected country. By default, it
uses the most recent year; selecting a point on the disaster-frequency line chart updates the diagram to that specific year.
Supported Tasks:
 A1 (understand relative impact of various climate hazards)
 A3 (retrieve detailed information for a selected country)
Interactivity:
 Click on year in the disaster line chart → updates the Sankey diagram.
 Hover over a flow → shows disaster type + count.
 Automatically updates when a new country is selected.
Why a Sankey diagram for A1/A3?
WWF activists need to understand which hazards dominate in a country. A Sankey diagram communicates proportions and flows much
more effectively than pie charts or stacked bars, especially when multiple categories exist.
Dashboard for data journalists:
View 1 — Relation Between Subsidies and Taxes (Scatter Plot)
Description
This scatter plot shows each country as a dot, with:
 x-axis: fossil fuel subsidies (dataset 09)
 y-axis: environmental taxes (dataset 07)
Austria is highlighted in red; all others appear in grey. Selecting a country in any other view highlights it here; clicking a dot selects
that country and switches the dashboard to detail mode.
Supported Tasks:
Abdalrahman Mohammed 7 WS 25
 J3: Discover relationship between subsidies and taxes.
 J1: Highlight Austria’s position relative to peers.
Why a scatter plot?
Scatter plots are the most effective encoding for relational tasks (J3), allowing journalists to detect correlations, outliers, and contradictions (e.g.,
high taxes but also high subsidies). Position encodes magnitude precisely and avoids misinterpretation.
Interactivity & Linking:
 Hover: Shows country name and exact values.
 Click: Selects country → updates all views (climate indicators panel, discrepancy chart, bar chart).
 Linked selections: Selection in climate-indicator view highlights the dot here.
View 2 — Climate-Change Indicators Panel (Paired Line Charts)
Description
This panel compares Austria to world averages (overview mode) or to a selected country (detail mode) across three indicators:
 temperature anomaly (23)
 CO₂ emissions or disaster frequency (using 14 or 04)
 optional additional environmental variable
Each indicator is displayed as a small-multiple line chart: red for Austria, blue for the comparison country.
Supported Tasks:
 J1: Compare Austria to other countries across multiple climate indicators.
 J3: Selection here highlights the corresponding dot in the scatter plot.
Why line charts?
Line charts are optimal for temporal tasks (J1), showing long-term trajectories and enabling users to compare slopes, crossings, and divergences.
Interactivity & Linking:
 Dropdown menu: Select comparison country. Chosen over a map to enable rapid lookup of specific or small nations without
zooming.Hover: Tooltip with exact year + value.
 Linked: Selecting a country here highlights it in the scatter plot and updates the discrepancy and bar charts.
 “Remove selection” button: Returns the dashboard to overview mode.
View 3 — Discrepancy View (Taxes – Expenditures Line Chart)
Description
This view shows how much a country’s environmental tax revenue exceeds (or falls short of) its environmental protection expenditures over time.
In overview mode: Austria vs world average
In detail mode: Austria vs selected country
Supported Tasks:
 J2: Reveal discrepancies between taxes and expenditures.
 J1: Provide context for Austria’s financial climate commitment.
Why a line chart?
The discrepancy is a derived time-series metric. Line charts effectively show whether the gap is widening or narrowing and allow direct slope
comparison between Austria and another country.
Interactivity & Linking:
 Click on any point in the discrepancy chart → updates the detailed bar chart (View 4) for that specific year.
 Hover: Shows the precise discrepancy value.
 Linked to View 4: Year selection triggers a synchronized update.
View 4 — Taxation vs Expenditure Detail (Bar Chart)
Description
This bottom view shows the raw values of:
 environmental taxes (07)
 environmental protection expenditures (08)
for the country selected in any earlier interaction.
Bars corresponding to the clicked year from the discrepancy chart are highlighted.
Supported Tasks:
 J2: Inspect detailed financial values for a selected year.
 J1: Compare raw tax/spending levels clearly.
Why a bar chart?
Bar charts provide the most accurate magnitude comparison between discrete categories (tax vs expenditure) and are ideal for J2, where
precision matters.
Interactivity & Linking:
 Hover: Shows country, year, and exact value.
 Linked: Updates when a country is selected or a year is clicked in the discrepancy view.
 Default: Shows Austria’s values without highlights in overview mode.
4. Reflection (15 points)
The WWF dashboard provides a balanced combination of overview, comparison, and detail views, enabling users to efficiently perform Tasks
A1–A3. The world map and linked charts allow users to quickly identify climate-impact hotspots, compare trends, and retrieve detailed information
about specific countries.
Abdalrahman Mohammed 8 WS 25
Efficiency for Users
Users can complete core tasks rapidly because each visualization aligns with a specific analytical action. The world map supports immediate
spatial understanding (A1), the line charts reveal temporal evolution without requiring additional navigation (A1, A3), the ranking bar chart enables
fast comparison across countries (A2), and the Sankey diagram provides an intuitive breakdown of disaster types (A3). Interactions are minimal
and direct—clicking or hovering is sufficient to access deeper information—leading to low cognitive load.
Balancing Visual Encodings with Data Attributes
Each visual encoding was chosen based on the perceptual effectiveness of the corresponding data type. Geographic patterns are best expressed
spatially (map), temporal changes via slopes and trajectories (line charts), quantitative comparison through length (bar chart), and categorical
composition via flow width (Sankey). Separating the three metrics into small multiples avoids overplotting and preserves clarity. This ensures all
attributes—spatial, temporal, categorical—are encoded using the most expressive channels available.
Overview vs. Detail View
The overview views include the world map (global disaster patterns), the global-average line charts, and the initial ranking chart. Detail views
include country-specific line charts, the Sankey diagram for disaster composition, and the ranking recalculated around the selected country. The
“Remove Selection” button reinforces a clear separation between the two modes. This structure follows Shneiderman’s mantra: overview → zoom
and filter → details on demand.
Interaction Tradeoffs and Limitations
The dashboard restricts interactions to essential actions (select, hover, filter), avoiding complex UI mechanisms that would slow down analysis.
This improves usability but limits advanced manipulation such as multi-country comparison or user-defined data transformations. Another
limitation is the Sankey diagram’s dependence on disaster-type availability; countries with sparse records may show limited detail. Sea-level
change is unavailable for non-coastal regions, which may lead to empty or suppressed line charts, though this avoids misleading zero values.
Linking Between Views
All views are tightly linked: selecting a country updates the line charts, recomputes the ranking view, and refreshes the disaster-type distribution.
Selecting a year on the disaster-frequency chart updates the Sankey diagram for that specific year. The map selection also synchronizes tooltips
and highlights across charts. This coordinated linking enables smooth navigation between global context and specific details and ensures that
every task (A1–A3) is supported with minimal effort.
The Data Journalist Dashboard is optimized for rapid comparison, discrepancy detection, and relational analysis of Austria’s climate-related
financial indicators. It allows users to easily identify how Austria differs from other countries and to understand underlying policy contradictions.
The design emphasizes clarity, minimal interaction overhead, and strong linked-view coordination.
Efficiency of User Tasks
Journalists can complete core tasks quickly because each view is purpose-built for its corresponding analytical need. The climate-indicators panel
(overview mode) enables immediate comparison between Austria and world averages for temperature, CO₂ emissions, and disaster frequency
(J1). The subsidies–taxes scatter plot allows fast identification of whether Austria aligns with peers (J3), while the discrepancy view highlights
mismatches between taxes and environmental expenditures (J2). Selecting a country instantly updates all relevant views, allowing journalists to
pivot between comparison targets with minimal friction.
Balancing Effective Visual Encodings and Data Complexity
Each dataset is encoded using a visualization type that maximizes perceptual accuracy.
 Scatter plot: position encodes subsidies and taxes, ideal for correlation tasks (J3).
 Line charts: support temporal trend exploration (J1, J2).
 Bar charts: provide accurate magnitude comparison for taxation vs. expenditure details (J2).
Grouping indicators into small multiples avoids overplotting and preserves clarity, even when comparing Austria to another country.
Overview vs. Detail Views
The overview views include the climate-indicator panel (Austria vs world), the scatter plot (all countries), and the discrepancy view comparing
Austria to global trends.
Detail views appear after selection: the indicator panel switches to Austria vs selected country, the discrepancy view updates to the chosen
comparison, and the bottom bar chart reveals specific tax/expenditure values for a selected year. This aligns with the recommended workflow of
overview → zoom/filter → details on demand.
Interaction Tradeoffs and Limitations
Interactions were intentionally limited to simple operations—selecting a country, clicking a data point, and hovering for details—to maintain
accessibility for nontechnical users. This simplicity improves usability but limits more advanced comparisons like selecting multiple countries
simultaneously. Another limitation is that data availability varies across indicators (e.g., some countries have partial subsidy records), which may
restrict the interpretability of the scatter plot. Austria’s landlocked status also limits relevance of sea-level data, though this is handled by
suppressing values rather than misrepresenting them. We selected a drop-down over a map to prioritize known-item lookup (Task J1) and
conserve screen space for complex financial charts.
Linking Between Views
The dashboard uses consistent bidirectional linking:
 Selecting a country updates the indicator panel, the discrepancy view, and highlights the corresponding dot in the scatter plot.
 Selecting a year in the discrepancy view updates the bar chart.
 Interaction in the indicator panel or scatter plot keeps the user’s context intact across views.
This coordinated linking ensures that Tasks J1–J3 can be performed smoothly and supports seamless movement between high-level
comparison and detailed financial inspection.
5. Conclusion (5 points)
This report presented two dashboard designs tailored to the distinct analytical needs of WWF activists and data journalists. Both dashboards apply
essential visualization principles by using spatial encodings for geographic patterns, line charts for temporal trends, bar charts for magnitude
comparisons, and coordinated multiple views to support the workflow of overview → zoom/filter → details on demand.
The WWF dashboard emphasizes exploration of global climate impacts, enabling users to investigate regional hazards, compare countries, and
obtain detailed ecological information. The Data Journalist dashboard prioritizes clarity in financial and policy-related indicators, supporting efficient
comparison between Austria and other countries, discrepancy detection, and relational analysis between subsidies and environmental taxes.
Interactions were intentionally kept simple—primarily selection, clicking, and hovering—to minimize cognitive load while preserving expressive
analytical capability. The main tradeoffs concern the restriction to single-country comparisons and variations in data completeness across indicators.

(Matches the domain tasks J1–J3 in your A4 report.)
Datasets used:
 Dataset 04: CO₂ emissions
 Dataset 07: Environmental taxes
 Dataset 08: Environmental protection expenditures
 Dataset 09: Fossil fuel subsidies
 Dataset 14: Climate-related disaster frequency
 Dataset 23: Surface temperature change
 Dataset 25: Mean sea-level change
Early conceptual sketches / idea fragments:
 A world map colored by a climate indicator score (composed of CO₂ emissions, temperature anomaly, disaster frequency, sea-level trend).
 Journos select a country on map → see Austria vs. that country.
 Paired line charts comparing Austria vs selected country for taxes/expenditures/temperature/CO₂.
 Donut or bar breakdown for tax or expenditure categories upon clicking a time-series point.
 Scatterplot showing fossil fuel subsidies vs environmental taxes (Austria highlighted).
 Combined “bar relation view” comparing subsidy/taxation difference for many countries.
 Option: one large scatterplot (similar to final concept in A4) + smaller disaggregated indicator charts.
 Idea of using two-level detail:
o Overview (map + scatterplot)
o Detail (country-specific trends + breakdown distributions).
Selection mechanisms:
 Map-based selection (color-coded by climate score).
 Alternative: dropdown; but avoided unless necessary.
 Clicking a time-series point opens distribution view (tax or expenditure categories).
Temporal considerations:
 Map shows only latest available year to avoid clutter.
 Line charts show full historical evolution.

2- Design 1
Concept Summary:
A color-coded climate-score map allows quick identification of countries with notable climate or policy patterns. Line charts flank the map, comparing Austria with any
selected country. Each line chart links to a donut-chart breakdown. A scatterplot at bottom matches the one in the main dashboard.
1. Climate Score World Map (Top Left)
 Color scheme = climate score derived from:
CO₂ (04), temperature (23), sea-level (25), disaster frequency (14).
 Shows latest year only.
 Selection → updates all views.
Supports J1.
2. Line Chart: Environmental Taxes (Left)
 Austria vs selected country.
 Clicking a point → shows donut chart with taxation distribution (energy, transport, resources, etc.).
Uses dataset 07 and its subcategories.
Supports J2.
3. Line Chart: Environmental Expenditures (Right)
 Austria vs selected country.
 Clicking a point → opens expenditure-distribution donut (analogous to taxation).
Uses dataset 08.
Supports J2.
4. Donut Chart (Left) — Tax Categories Breakdown
 Shows how the selected year’s taxes are distributed.
 Temporary pop-up view.
5. Donut Chart (Right) — Expenditure Categories Breakdown
 Same idea but for expenditures.
6. Scatter Plot (Bottom)
 X-axis: fossil fuel subsidies (09).
 Y-axis: environmental taxes (07).
 Austria highlighted (consistent with final dashboard).
Supports J3.
Strengths
 Strong separation between fiscal breakdown (donuts), temporal evolution (lines), and global context (map).
 Easy to understand for news audiences.
Weaknesses
 Pop-ups may be penalized unless justified.
 Map interpretation depends heavily on climate score transparency.

3- Design 2
Concept Summary:
This design keeps the climate-score map but emphasizes temporal comparison: two large line charts (top = selected country; bottom = Austria). A central panel presents
distribution of categories based on selected time-series point. Right side shows a combined subsidy/taxation bar chart.
1. Climate Score Map (Top Center)
 Same scoring method as Idea 1.
 Displays most recent year.
 User selects comparison country.
Supports J1.
2. Upper Line Chart (Selected Country)
 Time series for expenditure (08) and taxation (07).
 Clicking a point triggers update of central distribution bar.
Supports J2.
3. Lower Line Chart (Austria)
 Same variables, Austria baseline.
 Visual parallelism allows easy comparison.
Supports J1, J2.
4. Central Distribution Bar
 Horizontal stacked bar showing category distribution for tax or expenditure of the clicked point (depending on which chart was clicked).
 Represents categories such as energy, transport, waste, etc.
Supports J2.
5. Combined Subsidy–Tax Bar Chart (Right)
 Shows two bars per country:
o Fossil fuel subsidies (09)
o Environmental taxes (07)
 Easy magnitude comparison.
 Strong complement to scatterplot in Idea 1.
Supports J3.
Strengths
 Very clear Austria vs country comparison via two parallel line charts.
 Central distribution panel avoids pop-ups.
 Combined bar chart simplifies relational comparison.
Weaknesses
 More space-consuming.
 Lacks scatterplot relational insight unless added below.

4- Design 3
1. Scatter Plot (Top Left)
 X-axis: fossil fuel subsidies (09).
 Y-axis: environmental taxes (07).
 Austria always highlighted in red.
 Selecting a country updates all other views.
Supports J3.
2. Indicator Comparison Panel (Top Right)
 Small multiple line charts comparing:
o Temperature anomaly (23)
o Disaster frequency or CO₂ emissions (14 or 04)
o Optional: sea-level where available (25)
 Red = Austria, blue = selected country (or world average in overview mode).
Supports J1.
3. Discrepancy Line Chart (Center)
 Shows (tax – expenditure) over time for Austria vs selected country.
 Selecting a year updates the detailed bar chart.
Uses datasets 07 & 08.
Supports J2.
4. Taxation vs Expenditure Detail Bar Chart (Bottom)
 Two bars for selected year: environmental taxes (07) and expenditures (08).
 Updates whenever a time-series point is clicked in the discrepancy chart.
Supports J2.
Strengths
 Minimal interaction complexity—ideal for journalists.
 Strong coordination between all views.
 No pop-ups; avoids sliders and dropdowns except country selector.
 Aligns directly with your A4 text and grading guidelines.
Weaknesses
 Lacks global map for spatial overview.
 Emphasizes relational/financial analysis rather than broader climate context.
